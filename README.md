# Fabric Prediction
Final Project for DSCI478.
We are extending research from "Textile Weaving Dataset for Machine Learning to predict Rejection and Production" by Toufique Ahmed and Shihab Uddin (2023), with the original paper available in our directory. We sought to achieve what had been proposed in the original paper: utilizing machine learning techniques in order to predict fabric production and rejection amounts of a weaving factory. In the file "DSCI478_Final_Project.ipynb", we have the following methods: MLR, GAMs, and neural networks, and in the file "R_implementation.Rmd", we have: MLR, ridge regression, and LASSO.
